"""

To evaluate whether a tweet is 'good' or 'bad', we'll tokenize the tweet, and then stemmize each word in the tweet.
We'll associate each stem with a positive or negative value using a dictionary.

Finally, we'll calculate the average word weight of a tweet, and decide if it's a good or bad tweet based on that.
